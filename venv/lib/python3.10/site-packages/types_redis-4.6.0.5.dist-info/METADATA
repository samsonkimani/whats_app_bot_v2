## Typing stubs for redis

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `redis` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`redis`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/redis. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `redis` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 5.0.0. Please uninstall the `types-redis`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `32b750b6aa2396cdaa757da16da8cd8fb627c09f` and was tested
with mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.323, and
pytype 2023.8.14.
